My first project was originally a place consisting of a while loop that spat out basic parts each iteration with the intention to lag a player's device.

After a few months, I came back to improve the game by creating a group of parts that would be more expensive for a computer to loop and render, decreasing the onset of lag. 

In the last phase of its development, I added an fps counter for the game.
